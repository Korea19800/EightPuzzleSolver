# EightPuzzleSolver

Solving Eight Puzzle using BFS and A* search

The program should do the following:

Print a welcome message and inform the user what the program is doing.

 Prompt the user to enter a file name containing an eight-puzzle that you wish to solve. This
file will contain a 3x3 grid of digits. If the file does not load properly, print an error message
and end the program. Some example files are provided on the Moodle site.

 Print the initial state of the puzzle.


 Prompt the user to select which algorithm they wish to run on this puzzle. If you are
implementing DFS, also prompt the user for a depth limit.


 Run the selected algorithm on the initial state.


 When the algorithm is finished, the program should print the following information:


o Print all the states in the path from the start state to the goal state.


o Print the length of that path (the number of moves required to solve the puzzle).


o Print the total number of nodes expanded while doing the search.
